#  Forecasting Hourly Energy Consumption with LSTM Networks

This project focuses on predicting **hourly power usage** using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to improve **energy grid efficiency** and enable proactive grid management. By leveraging the PJM Interconnection dataset, we aim to develop a robust deep learning model that captures complex time-series patterns in electricity consumption data.

---

##  Problem Statement

Accurate forecasting of hourly energy consumption is vital for efficient electricity distribution, cost savings, and sustainability. Traditional models often fail to capture the non-linear and dynamic nature of power usage patterns caused by:

- Time of day and day of week
- Weather conditions
- Public holidays
- Human activity trends

---

##  Objectives

- Preprocess PJM energy dataset (handle missing values, outliers, and scaling)
- Engineer temporal features (hour, day, weekend/weekday, holidays)
- Visualize consumption patterns and correlation insights
- Develop an optimized LSTM-based forecasting model
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE
- Compare results with baseline models (Persistence, ARIMA)
- Deploy an accurate and interpretable forecasting solution
